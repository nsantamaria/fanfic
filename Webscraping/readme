This is a program using the "Beautiful Soup" package to scrape all the pages of search results inputted from AO3. 

It will prompt for the name of the work you want to scrape for.

It extracts the following columns:
title: title of the story)
author: author of the story
date: date published
commissioned_for: who the story was comissioned for, N/A if not a comission
summary: summary of the story

chapters: number of chapters. The demoninator can be set to arbitrarily high by the author to my understanding
words: word count
link: URL of the story add "archiveofourown.org" before URL
story_body: the body of the fan fiction
category: categories of the relationship pairings (AKA M/F, M/M). "Gen or General means no romantic or sexual relationships, or relationships which aren't the main focus of the work." I did notice some will have relationship pairings but still would be Gen. It can also be set to other. N/A if not present.
characters: characters from the work as set by the author (these are tags)
relationships: similar to above, but are relationship pairings (ie Mickey Mouse/Minnie Mouse)
freeform: tags that don't fit into the above categories and are written by the user.
bookmarks: number of bookmarks
collections: number of times the story has been added to a collection 
series: some works are part of a series, it will say the series and which part (ie Part 420 of "Frustrated Data Science Student")

The script also includes error handling to skip stories with dead links or missing data. 
Additionally, the script sets a custom User-Agent header to avoid being blocked by the website's bot protection system.
